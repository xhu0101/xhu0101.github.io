I am a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Marketing at the Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia. My research lies at the intersection of **health marketing, innovation, and methodological development**. 

I examine how public health crises can spur pharmaceutical innovation and explore behavioral dynamics in healthcare markets, such as how physiciansâ€™ preferences influence patient compliance. 

On the methodological front, I tackle key challenges in causal inference, developing instrument-free approaches for endogeneity correction. I apply these methods directly to my substantive work, enabling more credible and robust insights.

Looking ahead, I aim to produce rigorous, policy-relevant findings by pursuing pressing substantive questions and advancing methodology when existing tools fall short. Through this dual focus, I strive to make meaningful contributions to both academic research and real-world decision-making.

Outside of research, I enjoy being in nature, including kayaking, paddle-boarding, hiking, biking, and learning to ski.

I am on the 2025-2026 job market. For more information, please see my CV [**here**](assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
