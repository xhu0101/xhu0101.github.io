I am a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Marketing at the Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia. I am on the 2025-2026 job market. 

My research lies at the intersection of health marketing, innovation, and methodological development. I examine how public health crises can spur pharmaceutical innovation and explore behavioral dynamics in healthcare markets, such as how physiciansâ€™ preferences influence patient compliance. On the methodological front, I tackle key challenges in causal inference posed by complex correlation structures, developing instrument-free approaches for endogeneity correction. I apply these methods directly to my substantive work, enabling more credible and robust insights.

Looking ahead, I aim to produce rigorous, policy-relevant findings by pursuing pressing substantive questions and advancing methodology when existing tools fall short. Through this dual focus, I strive to make meaningful contributions to both academic research and real-world decision-making.

Outside of research, I enjoy being in nature, including kayaking, paddleboarding, hiking, biking, and learning to ski.
